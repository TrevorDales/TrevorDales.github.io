Following the derivation outlined in <a href=https://fastrobotscornell.github.io/FastRobots-2025/lectures/FastRobots2025_Lecture13_Observability.pdf>Farrell's Lecture 13</a>, the dynamics of the system can be expressed as follows:<div align=center><img src=/Lab7/system_dynamics.png style=display:block></div><br> Now considering a step response from rest to a steady state velocity, acceleration is zero once this velocity is reached. The d and m terms can then be solved for: <div align=center><img src=/Lab7/solve_for_d.png style=display:block></div><br><p>d and m are lumped parameters that capture the dynamics of the system - how the car responds to control inputs and moves through the world. u<sub>ss</sub> is the constant control input being passed to the robot for this test. I decided to use an input of 1, corresponding to the maximum pwm signal possible (255). I did this because I wanted my dynamics to be accurate when my robot is moving quickly, as this is the ideal behavior of an accurate controller.<div align=center><iframe <pre class=z-code height=315 src=https://www.youtube.com/embed/EpUNBuIomIE width=175><code><span class="z-text z-plain">allowfullscreen> </span></code></iframe><h5 id=step-response-test>Step Response Test</h5></div><br> With this TOF data, I was able to calculate the velocity at each time step: <pre class=z-code><code><span class="z-text z-plain"># Compute velocity (finite difference method)

</span></code></pre><p>One problem I ran into is that my high step input meant that the robot needed to drive for a long distance in order to reach anywhere near its maximum speed. This was exacerbated by the fact that my front TOF only reliably worked up to 2000mm rather than the expected 4000mm. <br><p>My solution to this was to run multiple tests, starting from different distances to the wall. I then made the assumption that each test would have the same position and velocity curve shapes. Even though I would only get good readings under 2000mm from the wall, I was able to manually combine the data from multiple tests into one comprehensive position curve.<div align=center><img src=/Lab7/close_test.png style=display:block><h5 id=close-test-small-correction-velocity-units-are-in-m-s>Close Test - **small correction, velocity units are in m/s</h5></div><br><div align=center><img src=/Lab7/mid_test.png style=display:block><h5 id=mid-test-note-the-bad-readings-above-2000mm>Mid Test - note the bad readings above 2000mm</h5></div><br><div align=center><img src=/Lab7/long_test.png style=display:block><h5 id=long-test-note-the-bad-readings-above-2000mm>Long Test - note the bad readings above 2000mm</h5></div><br><p>Combining the velocity data from the valid parts of these trials into one comprehensive step response allowed me to get a better idea of how the car was slowing down:<div align=center><img src=/Lab7/combined_velocity.png style=display:block><h5 id=combined-velocity-data-m-s-vs-ms>Combined Velocity Data - m/s vs ms</h5></div><br><p>With this data, I then used the curve_fit function within the scipy.optimize module of scipy to fit an exponential decay curve to the data.

In order to be impactful, the KF needs to be able to run faster than the sensors, filling in the gaps between measurements with a more accurate model than just linear interpolation. To get this working in my simulator, I defined a higher resolution time span and looped through that instead. I also changed dt to 15ms to match the approximate speed of my PID loop on the artemis.<pre class=z-code><code><span class="z-text z-plain">i = 0

I fixed this by going through my entire setup and making sure every unit was unscaled (meters, seconds, kilograms only). Also, I found that setting the sensor uncertainty to an astronomically high number was a very useful debugging step. This meant the filter would ignore the sensor data, and I could get a good idea of the motion that the filter would predict using just the system dynamics and control input.<div align=center><img src=/Lab7/kalman_debug.png style=display:block><h5 id=note-how-the-filter-completely-ignores-the-sensor-data-this-filter-is-pretty-well-tuned-as-the-predicted-motion-mostly-matches-the-actual-motion-even-without-any-actual-fusion-between-the-two>Note how the filter completely ignores the sensor data.

Without this step, it was easy to falsely assume the filter was performing well - when in reality, it might have just been blindly following the sensor data rather than accurately modeling the system’s behavior. <br><br><h1 id=implementation-on-my-robot>Implementation On My Robot</h1><p>When sending the BLE command to my car, I made sure to make all of the tunable parameters changeable on the python side.

The general structure was a BLE command that sends all of the parameters; within this command a loop runs that repeatedly calls functions that collect data (TOF), predict motion (KF), and calculate/send control inputs (PID). <p>I also made use of global variables whenever possible to simplify the arguments passed between functions.<p>I implemented this with the KF interpolating between measurements, allowing the robot to adjust control inputs very quickly (the speed of the loop was about 10ms).<pre class=z-code><code><span class="z-text z-plain">while (millis() - start_time < runtime) //run for a fixed amount of time

The gains had the same effect as in the previous PID lab. The added challenge was that each time a new sensor value came in, the filtered data would jump to adjust to this, causing a derivative spike. I added a LPF to deal with this noise.</p><li><p>Measurement uncertainty. Lowering the sensor uncertainty led to a filter that followed the TOF sensors very closely - making this too low would mean the filter was subject to the same noise as the sensors. Too high, and the filter may drift too far away from the actual values.</p><li><p>Process uncertainty. Sig1 and sig2 represent the uncertainty in the process model for position and velocity, respectively. Low values for these parameters indicate high confidence in the model's predictions, causing the filter to rely more on its internal dynamics and respond less to sensor updates. High values signal low trust in the model, making the filter lean more heavily on sensor measurements. Risks and benefits of over/undertuning are similar to that of measurement uncertainty.</p><li><p>m and d. While these terms were estimated from experimental trials, they could still be tweaked. A larger m meant that the dynamics represented a car with more inertia - a control input would accelerate the car less. d plays more of a role scaling the maximum velocity and also how quickly speed decays when a control input is removed.</p><li><p>u. While the control input comes from the PID controller and probably should not technically be changed, I found it an easy "hack" for getting closer to my desired filter behavior. This could probably be replicated by tweaking m and d, or perhaps I have a unit issue. However, I added a standalone scaling factor to my control input - it still came from my controller, but I just found that amplifying its value allowed it to have the desired effect on the predicted trajectory.</p></ul><p>With all of this in mind, I spent some time tuning my controller and KF.
